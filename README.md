### V851s
V851S is a new generation of high-performance H.264/H.265 encoding SoC targeted for the field of IP Camera.

It integrates the single Cortex-A7 core@900MHz, RISC-V@600MHz and 0.5 Tops NPU and supports various intelligent application such as human detection and crossing alarm. V851S is also designed with a new generation of high-performance ISP image processor and video encoder with professional encoding quality, low encoding bit rate and mainstream-level image processing capability. In addition, V851S supports 64MB DDR2 and rich peripheral interfaces, such as USB, SDIO and Ethernet, to meet the requirements of various IP Camera products.
